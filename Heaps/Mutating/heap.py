"""Heap class.

This is the implementation of a heap data structure
from Week 9 of the course.

Note that this is not a recursive implementation:
there are no "left" and "right" attributes, even though
a heap is conceptually a binary tree.

This contains all of the Heap methods from the week:
lecture material, labs, and the exercise.
