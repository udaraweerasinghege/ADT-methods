Solutions to questions posted by David CSC-148 for review. 

Organized in the same way that questions are : http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~liudavid/csc148/week12/lab12.html

The first number of a file is the question number.

Some of these functions are sloppily done since I just wrote down whatever came to me first...

I pick helper functions over the probably more elegant while loops.

Let me know or send a pull request if you find mistakes! :)
